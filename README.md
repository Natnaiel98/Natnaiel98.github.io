- This is a function that returns a Fullback's heat map for Statbomb's 2018 World Cup data.
- The function accepts the name of a National Team that participated in the 2018 World Cup. The function returns an events heatmap for the different fullbacks of a team. The function only returns heatmaps for players  - with more than 50 event actions.
- The data in the two folders employed here were the free Statsbomb match and event data on the 2018 World Cup.

**Project 2:Ethiopian-Premier-League Tables**
- This project was focused on uncovering trends and interesting statistics in regards to the Ethiopian Premier League soccer tournament from 1999-2021.
- Obtained data from the RSSSF database for the data on the Ethiopian Premier League standings for the 1999-2021 time period.
- Cleaned and merged the data in order to perform data exploration.
- Produced tables and visualizations in order to present striking statistics and trends that have been witnessed in the league over the past 20 years.

**Project 3:AFCON-Group Disparity**

- This project analyzed how equal/unequal each group in the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) soccer tournament was by calculating the world rankings of the teams comprising these groups.
- Data was obtained from two sources: Transfermarkt for the National team standings at the time of a tournament and Wikipedia for the group composition for all tournaments held.
- Different measures to calculate potential inequalities in the strengths of teams distributed among the different groups. Different visualizations were produced to display these inequality between the groups.


**Project 4: Weather and Altitude effects on the Ethiopian National Team**

- This project aimed to analyze the performance of the national team from 2010-2022 and seeked to explore which variables determined the likelihood of a win/loss.
- Three dependent variables were selected for this analysis. The weather and elevation information were obtained from Wikipedia entries for the selected cities. The information on the matches played (city, result, if - the game was home/away) was obtained from the nationalfootballteams.com website.
- Various visualizations were produced to explore the relationship between the dependent variable (the result of a match) and the independent variables (height, elevation, home/away?). And regression analysis was - - - performed.
