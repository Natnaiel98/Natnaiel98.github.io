[**Project 1: Fullback_Heatmap**](https://github.com/Natnaiel98/Fullback_Heatmap)
- Produced  a function that returns a Fullback's heat map for Statbomb's 2018 Men's World Cup Soccer tournament.
- One of the recent major trends in Soccer is the evolution of the FullBack position. Managers have increasingly been training fullbacks to drift to more central areas of the pitch as opposed to their traditional role of sticking close to the endline. 
- The function inputs the name of a National Team that participated in the 2018 World Cup and outputs a heatmap with all of the actions performed by all of the team's fullbacks over the course of the tournament. The function only returns heatmaps for players with more than 50 event actions.
- The following visualizions display a contrast in Full back play styles. The first two heatmaps are of Croatian fullbacks Sime Vrsaljko and Ivan Strinic and show us that these players have been utilized as traditional fullbacks:

- Eventual champions Germany had fullbacks Julian Brandt and Jonas Hector, which often drifted centrally:

[**Project 3:AFCON-Group Disparity**](https://github.com/Natnaiel98/AFCON-Group-Disparity)

- Analyzed how equally distributed each group in the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) soccer tournament in terms of team strength.
- Team strength was detertmined using the National world rankings of the teams comprising these groups.
- Data was obtained from two sources: Transfermarkt for the National team standings at the time of a tournament and Wikipedia for the group composition for all tournaments held.
- Different measures to calculate potential inequalities in the strengths of teams distributed among the different groups. Different visualizations were produced to display these inequality between the groups.
