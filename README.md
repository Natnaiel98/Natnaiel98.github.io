**Project 3:AFCON-Group Disparity**

- This project analyzed how equal/unequal each group in the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) soccer tournament was by calculating the world rankings of the teams comprising these groups.
- Data was obtained from two sources: Transfermarkt for the National team standings at the time of a tournament and Wikipedia for the group composition for all tournaments held.
- Different measures to calculate potential inequalities in the strengths of teams distributed among the different groups. Different visualizations were produced to display these inequality between the groups.

**Project 4: Weather and Altitude effects on the Ethiopian National Team**

- This project aimed to analyze the performance of the national team from 2010-2022 and seeked to explore which variables determined the likelihood of a win/loss.
- Three dependent variables were selected for this analysis. The weather and elevation information were obtained from Wikipedia entries for the selected cities. The information on the matches played (city, result, if - the game was home/away) was obtained from the nationalfootballteams.com website.
- Various visualizations were produced to explore the relationship between the dependent variable (the result of a match) and the independent variables (height, elevation, home/away?). And regression analysis was - - - performed.
